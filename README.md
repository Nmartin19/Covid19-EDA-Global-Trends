> üìÅ [View complete SQL code here](/covid19_analysis_queries.sql)


Q1.-- What is the case fatality rate (CFR) in the top 10 countries most affected by COVID-19 by total number of confirmed cases?

QUERY: lines 32-46

    ‚Ä¢ Italy, the United Kingdom, and Brazil have the highest CFRs among the top 10 countries, with rates of 3.00%, 2.88%, and 2.75%, respectively, indicating a significant risk of death for infected individuals.

    ‚Ä¢ Germany, Russia, and Spain have CFRs of 2.44%, 2.28%, and 2.22%, suggesting lower but still notable risks compared to the leaders.

    ‚Ä¢ France, the United States, India, and Turkey round out the list of the top 10 countries with the highest CFRs, demonstrating varying levels of risk across different countries.

    ‚Ä¢ Overall, Italy, the UK, and Brazil exhibit the highest probabilities of death for COVID-19 infections, emphasizing the severity of the situation in these countries.



Q2.--  What are the top 10 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths, both in absolute terms and relative to population size?

QUERY: lines 65-83

    ‚Ä¢ Countries leading in absolute numbers don't necessarily show the highest rates when adjusted for population size.

    ‚Ä¢ Covid-19 caused severe impact in Italy which shows the highest mortality rate (0.20%) despite ranking 5th in confirmed cases (6.65%). 

    ‚Ä¢ Similarly, United Kingdom shows 2nd highest mortality rate (0.19%, tied with Brazil) despite ranking 6th in confirmed cases (6.53%). 

    ‚Ä¢ Other notable cases are United States (1st in case rate with 9.77%) and 2nd in mortality rate (0.17% tied with Spain), and Spain (3rd in case rate 7.54% and 2nd in mortality rate (0.17%)).

    ‚Ä¢ France shows different pattern with confirmed case rate of 8.33% (2nd) but ranks 6th in mortality rate (0.15%).

    ‚Ä¢ Lower mortality rates in countries like India (despite high absolute numbers) might indicate potential underreporting and/or Demographic advantages (e.g., younger population)



Q3.-- Which are the top 10 countries with the highest confirmed case rate per population?

QUERY: lines 98-114

    ‚Ä¢ Among the top 10 countries by total confirmed cases, only the United States appears in the top 10 (ranking 9th) for the percentage of the population confirmed positive (9.77%).

    ‚Ä¢ Andorra leads this ranking with a confirmed case rate of 17.13%. This means that 17.13% of the Andorra's population (13.232 out of 77265) was confirmed (or tested) as positive of Covid.

    ‚Ä¢ Within these countries, San Marino and Czechia shows the highest mortality rates (0.27% of population), followed by Montenegro (0.24%) and Slovenia (0.20%). The United States ranks 5th with a mortality rate of 0.17%.

    ‚Ä¢ This analysis highlights the significant impact of COVID-19 in the United States, where one might expect a lower proportion of positive cases compared to countries with smaller populations like Andorra or San Marino.

    ‚Ä¢ The high confirmed case rate in the U.S., despite its large population, indicates particularly widespread transmission of the virus. 



Q4.-- How have the monthly averages of total confirmed cases and deaths evolved from January 2020 to April 2021 in the top 10 most affected countries?

QUERY: Lines 130 - 158

    * Between January 2020 and April 2021, distinct COVID-19 waves were observed globally.

     - The first wave began in March and April 2020, followed by a summer decline in most regions. 

        ‚Ä¢ However, the United States and India showed different patterns, with cases continuing to rise during the summer months. 
  
        ‚Ä¢ The U.S. experienced a brief decline in August and September 2020, while India saw a continuous increase throughout the summer, peaking in September. India's cases then declined from October 2020 until March 2021, when they surged again.


    - The second, more severe wave began in October 2020, reaching its peak in December 2020 and January 2021. 

        ‚Ä¢ During this period, the U.S., United Kingdom, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Spain, and Germany experienced their highest monthly averages of both cases and deaths. 

        ‚Ä¢ Some countries, including Italy, France, and India showed peaks in November 2020, before experiencing a decrease in subsequent months.


    - A third wave emerged in March and April 2021 in most countries. 

        ‚Ä¢ Brazil recorded its highest monthly averages during this period, with 70,887 cases in March and 2,742 deaths in April 2021. 

        ‚Ä¢ India similarly saw both metrics peak in April 2021, reporting 231,443 cases and 1,630 deaths. 

        ‚Ä¢ Italy and France also experienced peaks in both cases and deaths in March and April 2021, with Germany and Turkey, also showed comparable trends.


    * Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States showed a progressive decrease in monthly averages from the beginning of 2021 through April, suggesting they did not experience this third wave durig March-April 2021. 



Q5.-- What trends are observed in new cases and deaths from January 2020 to April 2021, and how do they align with the vaccine rollout timeline?

QUERY: Lines 177 - 215

    - Western nations (except Italy) demonstrated a clear pattern: as vaccination rates increased, monthly deaths decreased. 

       ‚Ä¢ This trend was particularly evident in France, Germany, Spain, UK and US, where vaccination programs coincided with declining new monthly deaths, despite varying infection levels. 

       ‚Ä¢ France presents a particular interesting case, where the increase in new people vaccinated coincided with a decrease in deaths, despite a significant increase in new confirmed cases. 

       ‚Ä¢ The case of westerns nations, and especially France, demonstrates the positive effect of vaccine administration in reducing mortality among confirmed cases. 


    - Notable exceptions emerged in several countries. 

       ‚Ä¢ Italy, deviated from the trend observed in other Western European countries, experiencing an increase in deaths from 9,183 to 11,647 between February and March 2021. 

       ‚Ä¢ Additionally, concerning patterns were observed in Brazil, India, and Turkey, where despite ongoing vaccination efforts, outcomes were less favorable, suggesting impacts from healthcare capacity limitations and the presence of virus variants.


    - Vaccination success varied by country:

       ‚Ä¢ Most effective when combined with strong public health measures

       ‚Ä¢ Results differed based on healthcare infrastructure and timing

    *Note: These patterns are observational and would require statistical analysis to establish definitive causation.*



Q6:-- How did the percentage change in newly vaccinated people compare to percentage changes in new cases and deaths by country (December 2020 - April 2021)?

QUERY: Lines 233 - 273

    * The analysis from December 2020 to April 2021 reveals two distinct vaccination impact patterns across countries. 

      - Several nations showed clear vaccination success: 

        ‚Ä¢ France reduced deaths by 28% despite rising cases (+109%), while implementing a substantial vaccination campaign (+484000%).
 
        ‚Ä¢ Germany reduced deaths by 57% despite 34% increase in confirmed cases during its vaccination campaign (+1271% new people vaccinated). 

        ‚Ä¢ Similarly, the United States and United Kingdom achieved significant decreases in both cases and deaths alongside successful vaccination programs.


     - However, some countries faced different outcomes:

        ‚Ä¢ India experienced dramatic increases across all metrics, with cases rising by 672% and deaths by 756%, despite vaccination growth of 735%. 

        ‚Ä¢ Brazil and Turkey showed similar trends, with both countries seeing increases in cases and deaths despite significant vaccination progress.


    * - Vaccination effectiveness varied by country, influenced by:

       ‚Ä¢ Healthcare capacity

       ‚Ä¢ Public health measures

       ‚Ä¢ Local conditions



Q7.-- What are the total numbers and percentages of vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations in the top 10 countries?

Query: Lines 290 - 307

    ‚Ä¢ The United States leads vaccinations (67.7%, 224M people), followed by UK (56.39%, 38.2M) 

    ‚Ä¢ European vaccination rates: Italy (40.0%), Germany (31.27%), France (27.17%), Spain (24.32%), Turkey (22.82%). 

    ‚Ä¢ In contrast, highly populous countries show significantly lower vaccination coverage. 

    ‚Ä¢ India has vaccinated 133.6 million people, representing only 9.68% of its 1.38 billion population. 

    ‚Ä¢ Similarly, Russia and Brazil report low vaccination rates of 8.3% and 13.12% respectively.

    ‚Ä¢ Significant global inequalities in vaccine distribution and administration: 

    - Unvaccinated population contrast: U.S. (32.3%) vs Russia (91.7%) and India (90.32%)

    *Note: Data includes both partial and complete vaccination schedules



## üìä Conclusions <a name="conclusions"></a>


1 The analysis reveals a clear division between Western and developing nations in their COVID-19 response effectiveness. 

     ‚Ä¢ Western nations like the U.S. and UK achieved success in vaccination campaigns and death reduction.

     ‚Ä¢ In contrast, populous nations like India and Brazil struggled despite significant vaccination efforts.


2 Vaccination rate disparities highlight this divide:

     ‚Ä¢ India and Russia: Over 90% of population unvaccinated

     ‚Ä¢ United States: Only 32.3% unvaccinated


3 Healthcare infrastructure emerged as a critical factor. Nations with robust healthcare systems managed better outcomes even with high case numbers.

     ‚Ä¢ Highest Case Fatality Rates: Italy, UK, and Brazil. Suggests varying healthcare response capabilities


4 Population size didn't always correlate with virus incidence:

     ‚Ä¢ Smaller countries like Andorra and San Marino showed higher infection percentages

     ‚Ä¢ The United States was a notable exception among large countries


5 The pandemic evolved through three distinct waves, with varying regional impacts:

     ‚Ä¢ Western nations generally controlled their third wave through vaccination (March-April 2021)

     ‚Ä¢ India and Brazil faced peak numbers during the same period.

     ‚Ä¢ This temporal pattern, combined with vaccination data, revealed that successful outcomes required both high vaccination rates and strong healthcare systems, as demonstrated by France's 28% reduction in deaths despite rising cases.



## üí° Data-Driven Recommendations <a name="recommendations"></a>


    ‚Ä¢ Set up real-time alert systems monitoring both absolute numbers and population-adjusted rates (cases/population), using historical data from successful countries as benchmark thresholds for early intervention.

    ‚Ä¢ Prioritize resource distribution (vaccines, medical supplies, personnel) based on a composite index combining population density, healthcare infrastructure capacity, and current Case Fatality Rates.

    ‚Ä¢ Track pandemic response effectiveness using a combined metric of vaccination rates, death reduction, and healthcare system capacity, using successful cases like France (28% death reduction despite rising cases) as benchmarks.

    ‚Ä¢ Develop predictive risk models combining population metrics, healthcare capacity, and epidemiological data to identify vulnerable regions before they reach critical levels



## üîÑ Limitations & Future Scope <a name="limitations"></a>


    - Data Limitations

      ‚Ä¢ Time frame constraints: Limited to January 2020 - April 2021, with vaccination data only available from December 2020

      ‚Ä¢ Data reliability: Potential underreporting and varying testing capacities across countries affect data quality

    - Future Scope

      ‚Ä¢ Comprehensive healthcare analysis: Investigate relationship between healthcare infrastructure (hospital beds, facilities) and COVID-19 outcomes

      ‚Ä¢ Demographic impact study: Analyze how population characteristics (age, density) influenced mortality and transmission rates

      ‚Ä¢ Enhanced statistical approach: Develop statistical models to establish causation and create standardized metrics for cross-country comparison
